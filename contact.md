Tickets can also be made via this [form](https://catalyzeio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you do not have a Stratum login or are otherwise having issues with the Stratum portal.

In addition, please review the support sections of our Service Level Agreement [here](https://legal.catalyze.io/#service-level-and-support-agreement).

`Catalyze shall provide Customer support, which shall be available Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. To 5:00 p.m. Central time, excluding holidays.`

### Emergency Support

Catalyze provides emergency off-hours support for Severity 1 issues as outlined [here](https://legal.catalyze.io/#3-service-maintenance). A Catalyze engineer is on call from 5:00PM CST to 9:00AM CST the following morning. If an environment is experiencing a Severity 1 issue, file a support ticket via one of the following methods:

1. Submit a ticket through the [Stratum Dashboard](https://product.catalyze.io/stratum/) with priority "Urgent"
1. Call (888) 377-3184 and leave a message with contact information

Either of these methods will page our on-call engineer, who will respond within 30 minutes to take action to resolve the issue. If necessary, the engineer will initiate a call with the customer to assist with the resolution of the problem.
