# VPN Security

Communications between your client computer and the Stratum environment over the VPN are encrypted and secure. However, your VPN credentials provide access into this protected environment and should be safeguarded very securely. Please make sure that you are following all applicable information security policies, including what we provide at [https://policy.catalyze.io](https://policy.catalyze.io) and [https://hipaa.catalyze.io](https://hipaa.catalyze.io).

# OS X 10.10 and below IKEv1 Native Client Setup

On OS X, the VPN can be created via the Native OS X client. In **System Preferences**, open **Network Connections**.

Click the "+" to create a new connection. You will see the screen below pop-up:

![vpn_creation](../images/vpn_name.png)

Ensure that **Interface** is set to "VPN" and that **VPN Type** is "Cisco IPsec". You can name the VPN whatever you wish.

Click ok after setting those values. You will see the following screen:

![vpn_userpass](../images/vpn_userpass.png)

Fill in the **Server Address**, **Account Name**, and **Password** fields with the VPN Gateway IP, VPN Account Name, and VPN Account Password credentials provided by Catalyze.

Finally, click on **Authentication Settings**. You will see the following window:

![vpn_psk](../images/vpn_psk.png)

Choose the **Shared Secret** radio button. In that field, place the VPN Pre-Shared Key supplied to you by Catalyze. Click "Ok".

Now, click the **"Apply"** button for the connection and connect by clicking the **"Connect"** button.

# OS X 10.11+ IKEv2 Native Client Setup

Catalyze will provide a CA cert alongside VPN credentials. Save that file to your Desktop:

![vpn_osx_cacert_desktop](../images/vpn_osx_cacert_desktop.png)

Before you create the VPN connection, the CA certificate needs to be imported into the OSX keychain. Use "command + space" key combination to open search and type in "Keychain" to open the OSX keychain. You will see the below screen.

![vpn_osx_keychain_certs](../images/vpn_osx_keychain_certs.png)

Make sure that you are on the "System" and "Certs" tabs in the window. Unlock the Keychain by clicking the lock icon in the upper left corner.

Once unlocked, drag the CA certificate file into the window. You will be asked for your password again. When done, the certificate will be imported and look like this:

![vpn_osx_cacert_drag](../images/vpn_osx_cacert_drag.png)

Double click on the certificate and expand the "Trust" tab. Change the top setting to "Always Trust" as show below:

![vpn_osx_cacert_addtrust](../images/vpn_osx_cacert_addtrust.png)

That should remove the red "X" from the certificate.

Now move on to making the VPN. In **System Preferences**, open **Network**.

Click the "+" to create a new connection. You will see the screen below pop-up:

![vpn_osx_ikev2_vpncreate](../images/vpn_osx_ikev2_vpncreate.png)

After creating the VPN, you need to set the server address and username/password authentication. Add in the Server and Remote ID as shown below. Also click the checkbox to "Show VPN status in menu bar".

![vpn_osx_ikev2_vpnsettings](../images/vpn_osx_ikev2_vpnsettings.png)

Now that you have the server IP entered, click "Authentication Settings". Enter in the username and password you were provided for the VPN appliance.

![vpn_osx_ikev2_authsettings](../images/vpn_osx_ikev2_authsettings.png)

Now, test the VPN by clicking "Connect"! Once connected, the VPN should display a timer in the top menu bar in OSX while connected.

# Ubuntu strongSwan Client Setup

On Linux, Catalyze recommends using strongSwan directly as opposed to using the plugins for NetworkManager or other VPN clients. Those clients often do not properly configure the connection properly. This connection setup was tested on Ubuntu 14.04.

## strongSwan Installation

Most Linux distributions provide strongSwan in their package repositories. Execute the following commands to install strongSwan plus other dependencies.

`sudo apt-get install strongswan strongswan-plugin-unity strongswan-plugin-xauth-generic`

## strongSwan Client Connection

There are two pieces of configuration necessary for strongSwan on Ubuntu to function - the connection configuration and the connection secrets.

To create a connection, execute the following command in a terminal window:

`sudo charon-cmd --ike-proposal aes256-sha1-modp1536 --esp-proposal aes256-sha1 --profile ikev1-xauth-psk --host ${VPN_GATEWAY_IP} --identity ${YOUR_VPN_IDENTITY}`

You will then be prompted for your Pre-Shared Key and User Password.

Catalyze will provide each VPN user with the VPN Gateway IP, VPN Account Name, VPN Account Password, and VPN Pre-Shared Key.

## Example Connection Command

`sudo charon-cmd --ike-proposal aes256-sha1-modp1536 --esp-proposal aes256-sha1 --profile ikev1-xauth-psk --host 55.55.55.55 --identity bob@catalyze.io`

# Windows 7 strongSwan Client Setup

On Windows, the process for VPN connection is slightly different than for OSX or Linux. The connection is secured by X.509 certificate signatures and a username/password combination.

## Install the Catalyze CA Certificate as a Windows Trusted Root Certificate

Save the Catalyze provided CA certificate to your computer.

From the Start Menu, type "mmc" into the search bar to launch the Microsoft Managment Console.

![mmc](../images/launch_mmc.png)

From the launched window, go to File -> Add/Remove Snap-in.

![file_snapin](../images/add_remove_snapin.png)

From the pop-up window, choose "Certificates" and click "Add". Then click "Ok"

![certificates_snapin](../images/add_remove_snapin2.png)

Choose "Computer Account" when asked for the type of account.

![computer_account](../images/computer_account.png)

Click "Next" and then "Finish".

Finally, click "Ok" and you will be back to the main MMC window.

![certificates_added](../images/certificates_added.png)

Expand the "Certificates" tab and then expand the "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" tab.

![trusted_root](../images/trusted_root1.png)

Right click on the "Certificate" tab under "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" and go to "Actions" and left-click on "Import"

![trusted_root2](../images/trusted_root2.png)

You will now see the Wizard screen.


![cert_wizard](../images/certificate_wizard.png)

Click "Next". In the next window, click "Browse" and select the CA file you saved initially. Click "Next" and then "Finish". The CA certificate is now imported.

## Install the Catalyze CA Certificate as a Windows Trusted Root Certificate with Powershell

Copy the certificate file to directory on your workstation that is readable by your user account

Open Windows Powershell

The format for the power shell command to import the SSL certificate is

Command Format:

```
$file = ( Get-ChildItem -Path <path to certificate file> )
$file | Import-Certificate -CertStoreLocation cert:\LocalMachine\Root
```

Example:

```
$file = ( Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users\Bob\Desktop\cert.pem )
$file | Import-Certificate -CertStoreLocation cert:\LocalMachine\Root
```

# Using the VPN Connection

The VPN connection allows you to connect directly to many of the resources in your environment. Catalyze will provide you with a service map to use for your environment. If you are attempting to connect a database server, you will need to retrieve the connection credentials from your environment variables.

## Example Service Map

  - Postgresql on database-1: 10.255.0.1:5432
  - Postgresql on database-2: 10.255.0.1:5433
  - Redis on cache-1: 10.255.0.1:6379
  - Application on code-1: 10.255.0.1:8080
  - Application on code-2: 10.255.0.1:8081

## Example Postgres Service Connection

In this example I will use **psql** to connect to my environment' database-2 server running Postgresql. This example assumes I have a VPN connection up and running.

**Example Service Map:** Postgresql on database-2: 10.255.0.1:5433

First, I use the CLI to retrieve my database credentials:

`catalyze -E my_stage_env_name vars list`

Next, I look for the database service that I want the credentials for:

`DATABASE_2_URL=postgres://catalyze:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz@postgresql-1234567890.internal:5432/catalyzeDB`

The above environment variable provides the user(`catalyze`), the password(`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`), and the db name(`catalyzeDB`). Note that the port is **not** the same - use the port mapping provided by Catalyze.

`psql -h 10.255.0.1 -p 5433 -U catalyze catalyzeDB`

You will be prompted for the catalyze user password.

This drops me onto the database-2 Postgresql shell on the catalyzeDB database. Other database types can be accessed through similar procedures with their respective clients. Other programs such as database visualizers could also be connected.

## Example Redis Service Connection

**Example Service Map:** Redis on cache-1: 10.255.0.1:6379

Redis does not have authentication credentials within the encrypted environment. You can use the `redis-cli` to connect to your Redis instances.

`redis-cli -h 10.255.0.1 -p 6379`

## Example Code Service Connection

**Example Service Map:** Application on code-1 : 10.255.0.1:8080

This exposes your application container without going through the environment's service proxy.

Below is a simple example that will curl the port that the web server is on.

`curl 10.255.0.1:8080`
