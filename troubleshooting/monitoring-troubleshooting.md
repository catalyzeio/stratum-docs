# Monitoring Troubleshooting

## Monitoring is down

**I am getting a 503 when I try to view my monitoring page pod0XXX.catalyzeapps.com/monitoring**

- **Potential Issue:** Your monitoring service may be down or may not have been deployed
- **Potential Solution:** For some sandbox environments, monitoring services may not have been created. Contact [Datica support](/compliant-cloud/articles/contact/) to create and deploy these services.  Otherwise you can trigger a [redeploy](/compliant-cloud/cli-reference#redeploy) of your monitoring service by using the Datica CLI command `datica -E "<your_env_name>" redeploy monitoring`.

**One of my services is down and I did not receive a notification**
