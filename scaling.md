# How can I scale with Catalyze and Stratum?

Code scaling is increasing a system's ability to handle a growing work load. As the work of a system increases a system with a scaling method should be able to grow to handle the load. Code scaling often means adding additional application servers to a service to handle increased demand. This feature is built right into the Catalyze Platform feature set, contact your account manager or open a ticket [here](https://product.catalyze.io/stratum) via the "Contact Support" button for your environment.
